# Double Pendulum Simulation
This is a double pendulum simulation written in JavaScript for a Year 11 Software Design & Development Assessment. 

It simulates a chaotic physics system where a pendulum is attached to the end of another pendulum.
The length of these pendulums and the angle they are released at can be customised using the UI. The simulation uses the Runge-Kutta differential equation solver in order to provide relatively accurate results. 

Although the project has been assessed, it's still very interesting to play with and can be improved quite a lot, especially through code optimsation and UI changes.
